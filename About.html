                <p><b> Saat Paak and Subho Drishti:</b></p> In a traditional Bengali wedding, the bride is carried on a pidi (a wooden stool) and circumambulates the groom seven times. This ritual is called saat paak, symbolizing their bond and unity. Following this is subho drishti (the auspicious glance), where the bride and groom look at each other for the first time on their wedding day, surrounded by blessings and cheers from the gathered family members.</p>
